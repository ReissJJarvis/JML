          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Purpose</h2><br>
          The Joiner Process is an important part of business recruitment practices and instructs companies on the steps they must take to set up a new employee into the company.
          All businesses have some form of joiner process in place but often these are inefficient, time consuming or under-prioritised, reducing their effectiveness.
          Companies who ensure that they follow an effective joiner process gain many benefits such as:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensuring all teams involved understand the roles they must take in the process.</li>
            <li>Minimising the time spent onboarding new employees without compromising the effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Reducing the risks that come with employing a new worker.</li>
            <li>Allowing new employees to begin working as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>Presenting a positive and organised impression of the business.</li>
          </ul>
          The joiner process covers a wide range of onboarding practices to ensure that they are conducted in a streamlined and secure manner. These practices include:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Completing background checks on prospective employees.</li>
            <li>Assigning hardware assets such as laptops, mobile phones and accessories to new employees.</li>
            <li>Setting up user accounts, access to company networks and relevant application subscriptions.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the smooth running of the joiner's introductory period.</li>
            <li>Providing any relevant training that new employees require.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="TeamsInvolved">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Teams Involved</h2><br>
          The Joiner Process relies heavily upon the effective communication and cooperation of a range of different teams within each company.
          It is essential that all teams within the process understand their roles and the importance of the actions they're required to take.
          The main teams involved with the process are:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>Human Resources</h5>
              The Human Resources Department is the central team responsible for the Joiner Process. 
              As the team responsible for the movement of all employees within a company, it is their job to oversee the process and ensure that all actions are completed correctly. 
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  As the HR department has all information about new employees, they are the core team responsible for the Joiner Process.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>
            <li><h5>Internal IT Department</h5>
              The Internal IT team is required to ensure that all the technical needs of the new employee are met. 
              This includes the responsibility to prepare accounts, assets and permissions ready for the joiner to gain access to on their first day.
            <br><br></li>
            <li><h5>Cyber Security Department</h5>
              The Cyber Security team is responsible for ensuring the safety of the Joiner Process as new employees join the company. 
              It is their role to ensure that all individuals involved in the process abide by it to reduce the potential risks to the business which are present during onboarding. 
              For smaller businesses which do not employee a full security team, this responsibility should be given to a particularly security focussed individual in the IT or HR team.
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  There are many security risks that businesses open themselves up to during onboarding processes and it is essential that these risks are managed by a team or individual.
                  They must ensure that all actions and activities are done correctly and properly to minimise the chance of compromise to the company.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>
            <li><h5>The Joiners' Manager</h5>
              As the team lead for the new employee, the manager will understand the need of the joiner for them to complete their job. 
              The manager must provide the information to the relevant teams to ensure that the new employee gets the correct assets, accesses and training. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="BackgroundChecks">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Background Checks</h2><br>
          The first stage of the Joiner Process begins during the recruitment phase and aims to identify if potential employees could be a risk to the company. 
          This is done through a background check to determine the risk levels of applicants and should be completed or overseen by the cyber security team. 
          During this stage, those responsible should be looking for:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li><h6>Security Clearance</h6>
              Applicants with a current or past security clearance can indicate that they are more trustworthy and reliable.
              This could include clearance for the military or police or DBS checks for working with children.
              <br><br></li>
              
            <li><h6>Criminal Record</h6>
            The company should be aware of employees with a criminal record, especially if the offence is related to previous employments or other offences such as hacking.
            At minimum, businesses should inform themselves with the cirumstances of any offences and understand the increased risk the applicant could be.
            <br><br></li>

            <li><h6>Previous Employment</h6>
              Businesses can typically review their applicants' previous employments through their job application, CV or media such as LinkedIn. 
              This allows the business to view their previous responsibilities and roles to determine their reliability.
            <br><br></li>

            <li><h6>References from Previous Employers</h6>
              The employer can gain a good understanding of applicants in the workplace through the references provided by previous employers. 
              These references can inform the company on how they performed in their previous roles and their trustworthiness.
            <br><br></li>

            <li><h6>Review of Social Media and Privacy</h6>
              A review of applicants' social media allows for an insight of how the applicants view their privacy as the employer can view what the applicants post, interact with and share publically. 
              Through this review, the company can identify those who may not be particularly privacy aware as well as those who post negative comments or sensitive information about their employers.
            <br><br></li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="AssignHardware">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Assignment of Hardware</h2>
          In many companies, employees are provided a range of hardware to help them complete their jobs. 
          These products include company laptops, phones, headphones, chargers, dongles or monitors. 
          Typically in many businesses, it is the Internal IT Department who is responsible for the asset management and provisioning, 
          therefore requiring them to work with the manager on what assets the new employee will need.
          <br><br>
          The process of preparing assets for the new employee should be completed prior to their first day and consists of:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li><h6>Identification of Assets Required</h6>
              To begin this stage of the Joiner Process, the manager must provide the IT team with a list of the hardware which the new joiner will need to conduct their work. 
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  The manager should only request assets which are necessary for the joiner to conduct their job. Additional uneeded assets may provide extra risk and cost to the company.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>

            <li><h6>Asset Procurement</h6>
              Using the request provided by the team manager, the IT team must provide the required assets. 
              This can be done through keeping a backlog of spare assets which can be quickly set up or by ordering new assets prior to the first day.
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  It is essential for businesses who provide company assets to maintain an effective asset register to keep track of all company hardware.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>

            <li><h6>Setting up the Hardware</h6>
              The IT team must ensure that the assets they provide are in full working order as well as being wiped of any prior users or information. 
              In addition, any security settings, restrictions or company applications which are required by company policy should already be set up on the devices.
            <br><br></li>

            <li><h6>Preparing Hardware for Collection on Initial Day</h6>
              On the joiners' first day, the new assets should be easily available for the employee to collect and gain access to. 
              There should also be easy availability to an expert in the event of any issues or if the employee has any questions or issues.
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  Companies should provide a session with the new employee on how the devices should be used, any company policies they should be made aware of and ensure the employee sets up a password for their devices.
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="GrantingAccess">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Granting Access</h2>
          Prior to the joiner's first day, it is the responsibility of the IT team to ensure that they have access to everything they require to conduct their job. 
          To ensure that the new employee has the correct permissions, their manager should inform the IT Team to the accesses relevant to their job.
          The employee may need access to:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li><h6>Areas of the Internal Company Network</h6>
              Specific teams may require access to specific regions of the company network.
              For example, a new member of the payroll team will need access to the region relevant to ensuring employees are paid on time. 
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  The company must use access controls to maintain a zero trust policy. This means that no employee should have more permissions than absolutely necessary for them to conduct their job.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>

            <li><h6>Shared Team Regions</h6>
              If necessary, the joiner should gain access to areas specific to their individual team.
              This includes communiation platforms such as Microsoft Teams or Slack as well as shared drives such as Dropbox or Google Drives.
            <br><br></li>

            <li><h6>Third Party Applications</h6>
              In some instances, third party applications may be needed for the joiner to conduct their job. 
              The Internal IT team should set up an account for the new employee to log into and use. 
              In addition, for applications which must be paid for it is the responsibility of the IT team to conduct the payment or set up the subscription for the new employee.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br><br><div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
            <div>
              Companies should keep a log and record of the permissions granted to employees and conduct regular checks to ensure that these records are accurate. 
              Employees with too many or unknown permissions can put the business at high risk.
            </div>

        <section id="StaffTraining">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Staff Training</h2>
          During an employee's induction period, they should be given a range of training relevant to their job. 
          The company training should aim to make the employee more productive and efficient as well as more confident, safe and capable. 
          There is a range of training that employees should undertake:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li><h6>Company Security Policies</h6>
              The company should provide training informing the joiner of their policies around security. 
              Depending on the type of company, there should be policies including but not exclusive to:
              <ul>
                <li>Password Policies</li>
                <li>Internet Useage</li>
                <li>Downloading of Applications</li>
                <li>Adding Devices to the Network</li>
                <li>Using VPNs</li>
                <li>Virtual Environments</li>
                <li>Data Protection</li>
              </ul>
            <br></li>

            <li><h6>Site Access</h6>
              If necessary, the joiner should be given a tour of the company site as well as instructions on how to enter the site, including signing in and passing security. 
              In addition, they should be given details on where to park as well as other useful information.
            <br><br></li>

            <li><h6>Company General Policies</h6>
              The joiner should be given training and information on general policies that the company has, such as work times, lunch breaks and other useful information that they may require.
            </li>
