          <br>
          <h2>Purpose</h2><br>
          The leaver process details the actions that must be taken when an employee leaves the company. 
          This process is the stage of the employee life cycle which poses the most risk to companies. 
          Therefore, it is critical for businesses to ensure that they have a strong, thorough and strict leaver process. 
          Companies who follow a thorough leaver process gain many benefits such as:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensuring all teams involved understand the roles they must take in the process.</li>
            <li>Minimising the time spent offboarding employees without compromising the effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Reducing the risks that come from former employees.</li>
          </ul>
          The leaver process covers a wide range of offboarding practices to ensure that they are conducted in a streamlined and secure manner. These practices include:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Communicating with the employee so they understand their role in the process.</li>
            <li>Wiping and returning all company assets that the employee owned.</li>
            <li>Revoking access and permissions from all company data.</li>
            <li>Removing accounts, cancelling subscriptions and changing passwords.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
            <div>
              Due to the high risk presented by former employees, companies must ensure that they have a sophisticated and thorough leaver process. 
              It is essential that all tasks within the process are conducted properly and that no stages are skipped or rushed.

        <section id="TeamsInvolved">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Teams Involved</h2><br>
          The leaver process relies heavily upon the effective communication and cooperation of a range of different teams within each company.
          It is essential that all teams within the process understand their roles and the importance of the actions they're required to take.
          The main teams involved with the process are:<br><br>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>Human Resources</h5>
              The Human Resources Department is the central team responsible for the leaver process. 
              As the team responsible for the movement of all employees within a company, it is their job to oversee the process and ensure that all actions are completed correctly. 
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  As the HR department has all information about employees, they are the core team responsible for the Joiner Process.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>
            <li><h5>Internal IT Department</h5>
              The Internal IT team is required to ensure that all the technical needs of the process are conducted thoroughly. 
              This includes the responsibility to retrieve all company assets as well as to revoke the employee's accesses, accounts and permissions.
            <br><br></li>
            <li><h5>Cyber Security Department</h5>
              The Cyber Security team is responsible for ensuring the safety of the company as employees leave the business. 
              It is their role to ensure that all individuals involved in the process abide by it to reduce the potential risks to the business which are present during offboarding. 
              For smaller businesses which do not employee a full security team, this responsibility should be given to a particularly security focussed individual in the IT or HR team.
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  There are many security risks that businesses open themselves up to during offboarding processes and it is essential that these risks are managed by a team or individual.
                  They must ensure that all actions and activities are done correctly and properly to minimise the chance of compromise to the company.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>
            <li><h5>The Leavers' Manager</h5>
              As the team lead for the employee, the manager will have knowledge of all the accounts, applications and accesses which the employee has. 
              The manager must provide this information to the relevant teams. 
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section id="CommunicationwithEmployee">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Communication with Employee</h2><br>
          In the month prior to the leavers' last day, a meeting should be organised with the employee to discuss the leaver process and the actions they need to take in the process. 
          This meeting should involve the HR department as well as the employee's manager and should cover:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li><h6>Transfer of Responsibilities</h6>
              Typically, the employee will need to prepare to give over their responsibilities to someone else. 
              An action plan should be developed with the team manager to ensure that all projects the employee is working on is transfered correctly to the next person. 
              In addition, any resources, services or processes set up and running through the employee's accounts should be reviewed and an action plan developed for moving them to another employee or location.
            <br><br></li>

            <li><h6>Forwarding of Emails</h6>
              TThe employee should ensure that any important emails sent to their work account should be forwarded to their personal account. This can include emails about:
              <ul>
                <li>Payroll</li>
                <li>Pensions</li>
                <li>Employment Details</li>
              </ul>
              <br><div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  Team Managers should ensure that no emails containing senstive company data are forwarded to the employee's user account. The employee should only retain access to emails which they will require post-employment.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>

            <li><h6>Safety of Company Data</h6>
              The leaver must be informed of the importance that they do not retain or save sensitive company data after their final day. 
              This means that the leaver should be made aware and careful to not transfer any documents to their personal storage devices or accounts which may belong to the company. 
              For employees who are less security aware it may be essential to involve the cyber security team to aide them in what they can and can not keep.
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  Former employees retaining company information after the end of their employment poses a major risk to their companies. 
                  It is crucial that all involved in the leaver process, including the leaver themself, is aware and cautious of this.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>

            <li><h6>Final Day Procedure</h6>
              The employee should be given details about the final day and what they are required to do on the day.
              They will require details such as:
              <ul>
                <li>How to hand in their assets.</li>
                <li>Where to give their employee ID or pass.</li>
                <li>Any documentation to sign or hand in.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Return Hardware</h2>
          In many companies, employees are provided a range of hardware to help them complete their jobs. 
          These products include company laptops, phones, headphones, chargers, dongles or monitors. 
          When an employee leaves the business it is essential that these assets are returned to the company. 
          The IT team must ensure that the assets are collected, wiped and tested for any problems.
          <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
              <div>
                Companies should maintain a register containing details of all assets lent out to employees. 
                This ensures that they know what devies they expect to be returned at the end of employment and can follow up on anything not returned.
              </div>
          </div>
          <div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
              <div>
                Often, companies do not strongly enforce the returning of company assets. 
                It is crucial that all company devices are returned and wiped so that company data does not persist with a former employee.
              </div>

          <br>
          <h2>Removal of Access</h2>
          On the final day of employment, the IT team must revoke all access to company servers from the employee. 
          It is essential that this action is completed in a timely manner to remove their access to any sensitive data. 
          <br><br><div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>

            </div>
          </div>
          The employee may have access to multiple regions which must be revoked:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li><h6>Internal Network Permissions</h6>
              The employee must have all account roles removed so that the account can not access the internal company network. 
              In the event that the employee still has access to a company device and account, it means that the employee does not have permission to view any company files.
            <br><br></li>

            <li><h6>End Application Subscriptions</h6>
              Many business applications require accounts and subscriptions to use. 
              The IT team should ensure that any payments and subscriptions are cancelled so that the company is not spending money for an account not in use. 
              Furthermore, if the account should be removed from accessing the application or the password change to remove the employee from accessing it after their final day. 
              Some applications the employee should be removed from are:
              <ul>
                <li>Sharepoint</li>
                <li>Dropbox</li>

                <li>Github</li>
              </ul>
            <br><br></li>

            <li><h6>Removal from Company Communications</h6>
              All companies have a form of communication between members in and across teams. 
              The leaving employee should be removed from these communication applications. 
              These applications include:
              <ul>
                <li>Microsoft Teams</li>
                <li>Slack</li>

          <h2>Shutting Down Accounts</h2>
          After the employee has left the company, it is the responsibility of the IT team to shut down and delete all accounts belonging to the leaver as soon as possible. 
          This process should be communicated with the leaver's team manager and the HR team to ensure that there are no files, data or applications belonging to the leaver which are still needed. 
          Once the leaver's accounts have been verified that they are no longer required then they should be permanently deleted.
