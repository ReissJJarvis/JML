                  There are multiple teams responsible for ensuring the smooth running of the JML process but there are a few teams which must be majorly involved.<br>
                  The main team involved must be the <strong>Human Resources Department</strong> who possess knowledge of all the employee movements within the company and should oversee that all teams follow their roles correctly.<br>
                  The <strong>Internal IT Team</strong>  is also heavily involved as they're responsible for managing the permissions and assets of employees within the company.<br>
                  Finally, the <strong>Cyber Security</strong> team must be involved in the process as it has the potential to open the company up to many risks if actions are not done correctly.

                  <strong>Communication</strong> is the essential element to ensuring the JML Process operates correctly. 
                  Unlike most other processes within companies, it relies heavily upon multiple extremely different teams to work closely together.

                  Companies who ensure that they follow an effective joiner process gain many benefits such as:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ensure all teams involved understand the roles they must take in the process.</li>
                    <li>Minimise the time spent managing the movements of employees.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the risks to businesses from employees.</li>
                    <li>Allow employees to work in their new jobs as quickly as possible.</li>

                  The biggest concern is that companies give their new employees too many permissions. 
                  This can lead to new employees having access to regions and data that they shouldn't have or don't need. 
                  Employees should be given permissions based on a <strong>Zero Trust Policy</strong> where the company only gives them access to what they need.

                  As employees move between roles within a company, it is easy for the company to lose track of the accesses and permissions the employee has. 
                  This often leads to movers still having access to files, applications and conversations from their previous teams despite not requiring them any more. 
                  It is crucial for businesses to maintain strong <strong>Access Controls</strong> by removing any permissions that employees no longer need.

                  The Leaver Process is the stage where businesses can become <strong>most at risk to compromise</strong> as they often fail to "clean up" or remove old employee accounts.
                  Companies must ensure that directories are wiped, passwords changed, subscriptions are stopped and accounts deleted as soon as they can after an employee leaves. 
                  Dormant accounts from former employees are easy ways for hackers or previous employees to gain access to company networks and obtain sensitive company data.
