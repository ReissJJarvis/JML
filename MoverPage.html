          <h2>Purpose</h2><br>
          The mover process instructs businesses on the steps they must take to transfer employees between jobs within their company.
          Often, the mover process is overlooked, leading to shortcuts and oversights which open up vulnerabilities within businesses.
          Companies who ensure that they follow an effective mover process gain many benefits such as:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensuring all teams involved understand the roles they must take in the process.</li>
            <li>Minimising the time spent transfering employees to new roles without compromising the effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Reducing the risks that come with moving roles.</li>
            <li>Allowing new employees to begin working as soon as possible.</li>
          </ul>
          The mover process covers a range of practices to ensure that they are conducted in a streamlined and secure manner. These practices include:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Managing the permissions of the mover. This includes removing permissions no longer required and granting new permissions required by the new role.</li>
            <li>Managing the movers' assets if any assets are no longer required or if new assets need to be given.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Teams Involved</h2><br>
          The mover process relies heavily upon the effective communication and cooperation of a range of different teams within each company.
          It is essential that all teams within the process understand their roles and the importance of the actions they're required to take.
          The main teams involved with the process are:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>Human Resources</h5>
              The Human Resources Department is the central team responsible for the mover process. 
              As the team responsible for the movement of all employees within a company, it is their job to oversee the process and ensure that all actions are completed correctly. 
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  As the HR department has all information about employees' movements, they are the core team responsible for the mover process.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>
            <li><h5>Internal IT Department</h5>
              The Internal IT team is required to ensure that all the technical needs of the employees are met. 
              This includes the responsibility to prepare accounts, assets and permissions ready for the employee to change roles.
            <br><br></li>
            <li><h5>Cyber Security Department</h5>
              The Cyber Security team is responsible for ensuring the safety of the mover process as employees move around the company. 
              It is their role to ensure that all individuals involved in the process abide by it to reduce the potential risks to the business which are present during onboarding. 
              For smaller businesses which do not employee a full security team, this responsibility should be given to a particularly security focussed individual in the IT or HR team.
              <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
                <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
                <div>
                  There are many security risks that businesses open themselves up to during the movement process and it is essential that these risks are managed by a team or individual.
                  They must ensure that all actions and activities are done correctly and properly to minimise the chance of compromise to the company.
                </div>
              </div>
            <br></li>
            <li><h5>Previous Team Manager</h5>
              As the previous team lead for the employee, the manager will be responsible for ensuring the mover no longer has access to the previous roles' specific regions and applications.
            <br><br></li>
            <li><h5>New Team Manager</h5>
              The new team manager will be responsible for identifying the accesses, permissions and assets the mover will require to conduct their new role.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="TransferPermissions">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Transfer Permissions</h2>
          Within a company, different roles, teams and departments require different accesses to conduct their job. 
          When an employee moves from one role to another, they must be given the new accesses and permissions to suit their needs. 
          The manager responsible for the new role must communicate with the IT team regarding what permissions, accounts and applications that the employee will need so that the IT team can set up these permissions. 
          Additionally, the manager for the former role must inform the IT team what access the employee currently has but no longer requires. 
          From this information, it is the responsibility of the IT team to remove unneeded permissions and to grant new ones. 
          <br><br><div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
            <div>
              The company must ensure that permissions which are no longer required are removed to ensure that the company reduces it's risk to compromise. 
              This is part of the access control process by maintaining a zero trust policy.
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="TransferAssets">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Transfer Assets</h2>
          As with the transfer of permissions, it may be necessary for a mover to require new assets to conduct their work, such as a different type of laptop. 
          It is the responsibility of the new manager to inform the IT team of any new assets that will be needed. 
          Similarly, the mover may no longer require specific assets such as a company phone and should return this to the IT team. 
          Any assets in need of returning should be overseen by the former manager to ensure that it is done.
          <br><br><div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
            <div>
              It is essential for businesses who provide company assets to maintain an effective asset register to keep track of all company hardware.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>
            <div>
              The IT team must ensure they properly retrieve unneeded assets as these devices can contain sensitive company information. 
              If lost, stolen or not returned, these devices can cause risk to the company.
